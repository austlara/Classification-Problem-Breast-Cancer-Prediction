# Breast Cancer Classification

In this project, I am tackling a binary classification problem using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Data Set**.

The data set can be found at:

Using 30 features derived from medical images by researchers of the University of Wisconsin,
I utilized several data analysis and visualization techniques to determine whether a tumor is benign or malignant. The breast cancer data includes 569 examples of cancer biopsies and a diagnosis: "M" indicating malignant, "B" to indicate benign.

The 30 features are numeric measurements derived from medical images, which comprise of the mean, standard error and worst (ie. largest) value for 10 different characteristics of each medical nuclei image.

The following machine learning models were used:
  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbors
  * Random Forest Classifier
